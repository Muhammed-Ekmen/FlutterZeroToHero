Xcode describes{
podFile keeps your donwloaded packages of native
in the runner file, you can set up device orientation vertical situations etc
in the ios folder,when click the runner.xcworkspace will open the xcode youp project
bundleIdentifer is your unique key your app.
NOTE: set up your app device orientitation on xcode. So you don't need to call any method from flutter project, and app will be more performance
in the xCode runner/info that is your permissions. for exa add camera permissins. video13 1:16:30
appDelegate is your native ios projects start field.
}
androidStudio describes{
Android/app/strc/main/androidManifest keep your android permissions.
android project start in android/app/rsc.main/kotlin/mainActivity. similar to appDelegate
andoroid/app/rsc/main/res folder keep our app icons.

class User {
  final String? name;
  User(this.name);
}

class AdminUser {
  final String? name;
  AdminUser(this.name);
}
sayName functions doesn't accept the User class.

*part-partOf{
    that is communication structure from one private file to other private file, but it is't necessary be private file. 
     appbar example from veliBacik: part should be in your view class,part-of that is appBar should be in your custom appBar class.
  part '../Templates/custom_partappbar.dart';
  part of '../view/part_example.dart';
      NOTE: when you use the part of property in any class, that class will take all imports from file that keep part property. I mean, in the CustomAppBar class, we don't need to import material package is becasuse it already becomes from UI class.
 }

*atomic Design with button and callBack function{
you can use callBack function and retunr any value to UI
}

*VoidCallback usage instead of void Function (){}

 * FutureBuilder Usage. is it really necessary to use when we already using state management approach.
 * PlaceHolder Usage
 
 * state keep. on FutureBuilder. For example, think about the FutureBuilder with tabbar. there're 2 tabs on the tabbar. these are incluide futureBuilder and any text. when you tour the these tabs every time FutureBuilder send response to endPoint. that is very important performance problam. AutomaticKeepAliveClientMixin. how can You Use It?{
 "with" use with your class. after that, embed the super.build(context); in your class build method. (setState's build method) and override the  AutomaticKeepAliveClientMixin's properties. So, you must have code lines like that(
 @override
 bool get wantKeepAlive =>true;
 )
 So, from here on, your page always keep current state and it won't resend new response
 
 }
 
 *RESPONSIVE DESING TIPS ON ZEPLIN , think about your servilet app. you gotta think about the small or large device orientations. Normally,you have a 3 card on your servicePoint Card,isn't it? Probably, you made these accodring to responseive design . Perfect. but if your app run on very small device, that 3 card show good I mean these are no any layout problem. but these will be very small. That is problem. in this time, you shoudl think like these cards must be only 2 . becasuse screen is very small. Conclusion, you always think about the device screen. NO layout problem is not everythink. you should think about beautiful and proper seem.

** advanced postman usage Go to this link and just revise and check:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCEDjp3XMco

** base service view structure.
regrest_source folder (it's screen base*(name) folder)
      - model (you will kepp your api data models)
      - service (you will keep CRUD operations in here)
      - viewModel (your view controller. actually, we use getXController instead of this.)
      - view (your screen view)
you gotta go this repo and deeply examine each code line:

https://github.com/VB10/Flutter-Full-Learn/tree/main/lib/303/reqrest_resource

I need to explain one by one all file content.
VIEW: https://github.com/VB10/Flutter-Full-Learn/blob/main/lib/303/reqrest_resource/viewModel/req_res_view_model.dart



In conclusion, in the statefulWidgets second class extends our viewModel.

** you shouldn't create more than one HTTP or DIO object or whatever use. Go to this link:
https://github.com/VB10/Flutter-Full-Learn/blob/main/lib/product/service/project_dio.dart

** NEVER USE any logic method in view file. if the code does not seem on the screen, don't use in view file.

**The teacher only has created DIO object in here. After that, he has called this object from here.
** use the extension for String,Int stateful structures. I mean, there is no problem to use with flutter ready structure.For Instance:
https://github.com/VB10/Flutter-Full-Learn/blob/main/lib/product/extension/string_extension.dart

in this link, the teacher has added new property to String class.From here on, if you wanna use the any string variable, you will be able to reach the colorValue. Be carefully the teacher has extended String with nullable property. So, we will be able to use for nullable string values like String? name. Now, name variable use the this property.

** the teacher said that when you wanna create model file, if all values from postman body are not necessary, you can copy only data or necessary fields.

** if you use the stateManagement from outside, you don't have to use viewModel. Provider,Riverpod or Getx does instead of 
viewModel.

** create an project and use the provider in state management folder.

** jsonSerializeble/jsonDeserializeble, build_runner and json_annocation usage. THESE ARE SO IMPORTANT. SEARCH ON THE INTERNET
jsonSerializable: it has createToJson property. it prevents the create toJson method. you should add build_runner to dev_dependency. dev_dependency is not working on app runtime. It's run-in only developing time.

build_runner makes code generation liem artificial intelligent instead of developer.
Go to VB 1:12:24 at 15 video and use on any project.

@JsonSerializable(createToJson: false)

jsonSerializable: other property is filedRename. sometimes api keys are not case sensitive. I mean, you expect value like naemVeli but it would come like name_veli. that's situation, we can use this property.

@JsonSerializable(fieldRename:  FieldRename.... etc)


** equatable
NOTE: if you wanna use the equatable, you have to add final tag all class variables. Because of it only work with immutable objects.
NOTE: when you add equatable to class, it expects to you import get props=> [] properties. So, what is it mean? it says that I  will check values
but which values should I control is it same? In short, it compares 2 or more object.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj8gY-nSfd8 PERFECT SUMMARY. But the most important thing is why we need to use that? think about it, when you generate object from model classic there are 2 same object, app will create 2 same object and it will become performance problem.
NOTE: all objects has unique hash code. that is similar to ID number. at the above link, it has deeply mentioned.




16th VIDEO

** Lottie Usage:

the teacher said that there are 2 usage of lottie. These are local or network. it's similar to Image.asset or Image.network. The teacher again said that if you required is a few , you should keep in local.

you should keep local lotties under the assets/lottie folder. DONOT forget to add pubspec.yaml file assets.

NOTE:your local lotties comes with json format. I mean, loading_lottie.json

you can use lottie instead button. The link at the below. it's very simple lottie usage to button. You can think about image and Inkwell.
but you have to create an animation controller to lotto situation.
https://github.com/VB10/Flutter-Full-Learn/blob/main/lib/303/lottie_learn.dart

** Future.microtask usage.

FutureTask structures are execute earlier than other Future or Timer structures. That means, when you need to run any code line before the other Future code lines you can use it.
 Look at the below:
----- 
 void main() {
  Future(() => print('future 1'));
  Future(() => print('future 2'));
  // Microtasks will be executed before futures.
  Future.microtask(() => print('microtask 1'));
  Future.microtask(() => print('microtask 2'));
}
-----

when you run on the dartpad or etc. its output is in order:

microtask 1
microtask 2
future 1
future 2

NOTE: Future.microtask can be alternative of whenComplete at the end of the any Future structure.

** SINGLETON

Basically, get single structres in common fields. For example: that is too much performance problem to use too many static variables. We have asked the that problem
and we haven't gotton answer.NOW, we will. in the singleton structres, we reach the common variables with getter(get) property.
surekli kullanilacak ve degismeyecek

Some usage Defines: when you need to use regular and never change structres, you will be able to use singleton pattern. Remember the your values filter city,brand id etc.

Main idea is ; there is only one instance, it shouldn't generate from any developer. It should generate only once.at the below,I will add the classic and singleton usage of network manager class.

** some list tricky points,thjink about your project. you have a home page and campaing page. you was sending your campaing model to your campaign page. Actually, that usage
is wrong. what can you do?
first, create a list that keep campaing page like List<CampaignDetailPageCard> campaigns
second, use the map with your data from API like List<CampaignDetailPage> campaigns=campaignItems.map((e)=>CampaignDetailPageCard(items:e)).toList(); 

I mean, you keeps all campaign card in list. so, why shoudl we use that usage? Because when you give campaign in directly, when you change any part to model class, evrywhere
will change.

** some important list methods. use the lsit method instead of the for while if else structures.
take(5) gievs you 5 items from list.
map    you can use more than one map like exaList.map((e)=>e.toInt()).map((e)=>e.toString()).toList()
shuffle it mixes the all items.
asMap    it converts the list to Map type and its keys are index 0 to end,
whereType it gives what you want type from that list. EXAMPLE{
var mixList = [1, "a", 2, "b", 3, "c", 4, "d"];
 var num = mixList.whereType<int>();
 print(num); // (1, 2, 3, 4)
}

**NAVIGATOR OPERATIONS

in the main.dart file, you can use routes and initialRoute parameters. But there is a effective way to use nagitors.

Assume we have 3 pages and these are homeDetail,homeView and just profile. we will go to these pages with routes.
check the this link:
https://github.com/VB10/Flutter-Full-Learn/tree/main/lib/303/navigator


if you remember emre teacher was going same way. create navigator class like navigator manager. we gonna do same things.
https://github.com/VB10/Flutter-Full-Learn/blob/main/lib/product/navigator/navigator_custom.dart

I have added this link because that is not class. it is mixin. So, we only extends oru UI class with this mixix structure and we will be able to use it.
note: in this link the teacher has used the T. because he wanted to only valid for MyApp class.

** there is a property of enum. it is byName
-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*
void main() {

  var result=Trial.values.byName("one");

  switch (result){
      case
  }
}


enum Trial{
  
  one,
  two,
  three
  
}
-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*

so, you can switch case structure will fill automaticlyy.

** you can substring method from Strings. it separete the your string value. you can use it when you work on API base url etc.
** YOU SHOULD START THE USE ACTIONMANAGER AGAIN. it was true. the teacher said like this. in this reason,you gotta improve usage. but there is a additional field. USE THE
SINGLETON Strucure for ActionManger. Actually RouteManager.

===========================================================================================================================================
 NOTES:
** if you can don't keep data from API to any variable, direct use the related page. For example FutureBuilder.
** keep your base url image path with extension and enum classes.{https://github.com/VB10/Flutter-Full-Learn/blob/main/lib/product/constant/lottie_items.dart}
** static values, you can keep static_values file under the static folder.
** best practice api usage{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04j8jTJ7j8Q}
** you can keep query parameters query_param file under the a network folder.
** create Global folder for general datas. don't use General.
** MaterialApp title is text which when the app in the task manager, hamburger menu on the device.
** in the flutter root folder, there is a readMe.md file. you can take notes in there.
** you can use the appBundle instead of the APK building. appBundle has many advantages according to Apk.
** .sh Usage. 
create a folder like commands. 
create a file flutter_doctor.sh
inside the that file, flutter doctor and save.
when you wanna call that .sh file on the terminal:
sh /commands/flutter_doctor.sh
