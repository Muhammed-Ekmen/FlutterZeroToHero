*part-partOf{
    that is comminication structure from one private file to other private file, but it is't necessary be priveate file. 
     appbar example from veliBacik: part should be in your view class,part-of that is appBar should be in your custom appBar class.
  part '../Templates/custom_partappbar.dart';
  part of '../view/part_example.dart';
      NOTE: when you use the part of property in any class, that class will take all imports from file that keep part property. I mean, in the CustomAppBar class, we don't need to import material package is becasuse it already becomes from UI class.
 }

*atomic Design with button and callBack function{
you can use callBack function and retunr any value to UI
}

*VoidCallback usage instead of void Function (){}

 * FutureBuilder Usage
 * PlaceHolder Usage
 
 * state keep. on FutureBuilder. For example, think about the FutureBuilde with tabbar. there're 2 tabs on the tabbar .
